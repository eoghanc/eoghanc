GitHub pages for me, by me and to, well, you I guess!

##  [My CV]([https://eoghanc.github.io/my2pagecv.html])
For nearly twenty years, I have maintained a handcrafted html file as my Curriculum Vitae (i.e. my _resum√©_).
I pull it out and update it from time to time, but now I feel it's time to make things a bit more interesting.

By sheer coincidence, I remembered that github offers some hosting _gratis_. So, why not put the two together?

The name (2page) is back from when I had less content - I've kept it for sentimental reasons :)
